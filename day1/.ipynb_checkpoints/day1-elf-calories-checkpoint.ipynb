    "# Day 1: Elf calories\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the elves brought food with them on this journey to get some fruit for the reindeer, but they want to know how many calories each elf brought. We're tasked with calculating how much each elf brought in order to find out the max number of calories brough by a single elf. Originally, I thought we needed to know which elf brought the most, so the initial solution reflects that, but no. Just the max total calories is all we needed.\n",

Continuing in that fashion, I'll end up with the answer. But that just seems like a waste of computation. Even though it really isn't. We're not bumping up the capabilities of my mac here...
